    <p>Itâ€™s a normal school day or so you thought. You leave school for lunch and when you come back no one sees you as you walk through the halls. You later realize that you see some people that you have not seen around school before. You realize your worst nightmare had become true. You were stuck in a haunted school with a bunch of spirits. This had become their afterlife, a haunting reminder of those who truly never left.</p>
